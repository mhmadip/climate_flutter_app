# climate_flutter_app

A Weather Flutter application.

## Specs

This project has 2 screens, first one shows weather in your current location, while second 
screen let you write your city name to show weather info.

This project is using:

- https://openweathermap.org to get weather data using JSON.
- I did it as a part of the complete flutter course on Udemy by Angela.
- It is using API to get and update weather data.
- These libraries were used geolocator: ^6.2.1 for getting user location, 
http: ^0.13.0 for making network connecton , flutter_spinkit: ^4.1.2 for making 
the loading indicator.
